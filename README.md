## Code & Data for "Weak Genres" etc.

In general workflow starts from **00_preparations_exploration** - this script already works with pre-trained LDA model.  

However, you can follow all the steps of document-term matrix preparation (cleaning meter labels, filtering years,etc) from scratch: **prepare_matrix** -> **build_lda**  

You can also start from any **0x** notebook since lda output data is included in the repo from the start.
